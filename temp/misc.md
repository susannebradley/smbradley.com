- I write (and occasionally perform) computer science-/academia-themed parody songs. Check out my collection of parody lyrics!
- My husband [Nick](http://ncbradley.com) is also a Ph.D. student in computer science at UBC. As of this writing, we are using the same pre-made website template, largely due to laziness (...okay, mostly mine.)
- My favourite pastime is reading. Here is a list of some of my favourite books, as of 2018.
- I like to bake (and share the results at work and social events). My specialty is sourdough bread, but I also like making challah, focaccia, and some non-bread items like cookies, Ã©clairs, and the occasional math-themed cake.
