# Biography

Hello! I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the scientific computing lab at the University of British Columbia. My research focus is numerical linear algebra. Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master's degree in the sensorimotor systems lab at UBC and a B.Sc. in mathematics from Queen's University. My funding is provided by an NSERC PGS D grant and a UBC Four-Year Fellowship.
