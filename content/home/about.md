# Biography

Hello! I'm a Ph.D. student with [Chen Greif](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~greif/) in the [Scientific Computing Lab](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/) at the University of British Columbia. My research focus is numerical linear algebra. Before my Ph.D., I completed my Master's degree in the [Sensorimotor Systems Lab](https://sensorimotor.cs.ubc.ca/?q=cs-research%2Fssl) at UBC and a B.Sc. in mathematics from Queen's University.
