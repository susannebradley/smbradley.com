- I write (and occasionally [perform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeGWyRmwPQg)) computer science-/academia-themed parody songs. Check out my [collection of parody lyrics](tags/songs/)!
- My husband [Nick](http://ncbradley.com) is also a Ph.D. student in computer science at UBC. As of this writing, we are using the same pre-made website template (largely due to laziness).
- My favourite pastime is reading. Here is a list of some of my favourite books, as of 2018.
- I like to bake (and share the results at work and social events!). My specialty is sourdough bread, but I also like making challah, focaccia, and some non-bread items like cookies, Ã©clairs, and the occasional math-themed cake.
