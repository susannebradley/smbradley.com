- I'm the co-organizer (along with Chen Greif) of the UBC [Scientific Computing, Applied and Industrial Math (SCAIM)](https://sites.google.com/site/ubcscaim/home) seminar series.
- I write (and occasionally [perform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeGWyRmwPQg)) computer science-/academia-themed parody songs. Check out my [collection of parody lyrics](tags/songs/)!
- I'm married to [Nick Bradley](http://ncbradley.com) (also a Ph.D. student in computer science at UBC). You might notice that, as of this writing, we are using the same pre-made website template... now that's what I call ~~laziness~~ teamwork!
- My favourite pastime is reading. Here is a [list of my favourite books]({{< ref "/post/top-15-favourite-books.md" >}}), as of 2018. (For more details, you can also check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20164091-susanne-bradley) profile.)
- I like to bake (and share the results at work and social events!). My specialty is sourdough bread, but I also like making challah, focaccia, and some non-bread items like cookies, Ã©clairs, and the occasional [math-themed cake]({{< ref "/post/eigenvalue-rainbow-cake.md" >}}).
