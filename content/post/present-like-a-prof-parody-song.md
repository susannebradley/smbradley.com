"Present Like a Prof" is set to the music of "I'll Make a Man Out of You" by Matthew Wilder with lyrics by David Zippel. "I'll Make a Man Out of You" is from the 1998 Disney film *Mulan*. Alternative lyrics are by Susanne Bradley and Steve Wolfman (who has several of his own [academic parody songs](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wolf/songs/)).

Disclaimer: the lyrics below are for entertainment purposes only, and should not be construed as actual advice on how to give a computer science talk. The parody lyric writers are not responsible for any negative consequences incurred by delivering a research talk in this manner (like your audience being bored or concluding that you're a terrible communicator).

### Lyrics

> Deadline's getting closer to prepare your talk  
> But, look on the bright side -- maybe it won't suck  
> Sure, your research is not all that great  
> But with big words, and Beamer [^1] too  
> You'll present like a prof when we're through

> Amuse them through the intro, then you’re on your own  
> Assault them with some jargon while they’re on their phones [^2]  
> Sure, your intellect’s alright at best  
> But if you do just what I say  
> You'll present like a prof all the way  

> Not even sure my math is right  
> Boy, this talk is gonna screw me [^3]   
> Lucky there’s no grade ‘cause mine would be an F  
> These guys all seem really bright  
> Hope they don’t all see right through me [^4]  
> Now I really wish that I’d just been a chef

> Be a prof  
> You must distract them with flashy demos  
> Be a prof  
> From all the stuff they could criticize  
> Be a prof  
> Use Beamer slides full of math ungodly  
> Mysterious as “left as an exercise” [^5]  

> Just an hour left now -- but no time to stop  
> Do these slide revisions or your talk will flop  
> There’s a bug here in your demo code  
> A typo on slide forty-two  
> You’re no prof, you have more work to do  

> Be a prof  
> You must distract them with flashy demos  
> Be a prof  
> From all the stuff they could criticize  
> Be a prof  
> Use Beamer slides full of math ungodly  
> Mysterious as “left as an exercise”  
> Be a prof  
> You must distract them with flashy demos  
> Be a prof  
> From all the stuff they could criticize  
> Be a prof  
> Use Beamer slides full of math ungodly  
> Like, honestly, what on Earth [^6] is all that math?!

[^1]: For CS novices, this is a slide-making version of LaTeX (of CS conference ubiquity).  
[^2]: Admit it: this is totally you as an audience member.  
[^3]: The authors apologize for the harsh(ish) language.  
[^4]: Impostor syndrome is surprisingly pervasive in academe, so don't worry if this is you! To requote an internet meme: "Just because you're trash doesn't mean you can't do great things. It's called garbage can, not garbage cannot."  
[^5]: This footnote is trivial and is left as an exercise to the reader.  
[^6]: There's an opportunity for additional harsh language here if you replace "on Earth" with a different two-syllable expression of choice.
