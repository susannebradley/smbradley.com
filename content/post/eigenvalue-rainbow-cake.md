I was at a party for a [preconditioning conference](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~greif/precon17/) and agreed to provide a dessert: hence, my eigenvalue rainbow cake. Get it? Because eigenvalues and rainbows are both a kind of spectrum! I'll stop explaining my own jokes and provide some pictures...

#### Implementation details
I used [this recipe](http://divascancook.com/easy-rainbow-cake-recipe-from-scratch/) for the sponge. The frosting is an Italian meringue buttercream from The Culinary Institute of America's [*Baking and Pastry: Mastering the Art and Craft*](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00UGE1U8Q) (2nd Ed., p. 480).
