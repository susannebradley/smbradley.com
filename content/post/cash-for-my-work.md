### Lyrics

> Check out my proof[^1]  
> Isn’t it neat?  
> Don’t you think my erudition’s complete?  
> My scholarly work is renowned  
> In my obscure subfield[^2]  
> Look at my board  
> Messy, although  
> This math is genius, as far as you know  
> Looking around you might think  
> Sure -- I’m so brilliant  

> I’ve got lemmas and theorems aplenty  
> Mathematical prowess galore  
> You want elegant proofs?  
> I have many!  
> But who cares?  
> No big deal  
> I’m still poor  

> How do I make my research sound cool?  
> What are some trends  
> That will wow the funders?  
> Let’s slap on some AI --  
> With a neural net? Yeah -- deep![^3]  
> Got clever math, but that just won’t do  
> It needs applications that interest NSERC[^4]  
> “Yes, this cures AIDS[^5] and kills  
> Terrorists, and all for cheap!”  

> Grant winners buy  
> Travel and perks  
> Pay undergrads to do their grunt work  
> Spending with glee  
> Wish I’d receive  
> Cash for my work  

> If I did ML[^6]  
> I could just sell  
> Statistics for profit:  
> “We’ll target their ads[^7]  
> Based on data we grab  
> From their web history!”[^8]  
> But I can see  
> Not so easy  
> When all I do is stuck in theory  
> But to win this  
> Gotta spin it  
> All for the cash  

> I’ve gotta get grant applications in  
> No time to be clever  
> Just hit those buzzwords  
> "Something, something, deep learning[^9]  
> Something, blockchain”[^10]  

> For financial gain  
> How I would love  
> All the awards I ever dreamed of  
> Oh pretty please  
> Can’t I receive  
> Cash for my work?  

[^1]: Lots of computer science disciplines are more into mathematical proofs than into programming awesome stuff. See, e.g., [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) -- and, of course, my own field, [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis).

[^2]: "My scholarly work is renowned in my obscure subfield" is pretty close to a direct quote from my Ph.D. supervisor.

[^3]: [Deep neural networks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HintonDengYuEtAl-SPM2012.pdf): they're very hip in computer science, even though [nobody actually knows why they work](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/).

[^4]: For non-Canadians, this is the [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) (and is pronounced "EN-serc").

[^5]: And for Canadians: I am well aware that anything aimed at curing AIDS would probably fall under the mandate of [CIHR](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) (Canadian Institutes of Health Research) rather than NSERC. Poetic license, people.

[^6]: Stands for "machine learning" -- as of 2018, the hippest of the CS specializations.

[^7]: I myself [did work in machine learning]({{< ref "/publication/bradley15.md" >}}) during my Master's, and considered continuing it into my Ph.D. So if it seems like I'm taking a bunch of cheap shots at machine learning by implying that it's just [glorified statistics](https://towardsdatascience.com/no-machine-learning-is-not-just-glorified-statistics-26d3952234e3) to help big tech companies make more money from ad sales, at least know that I'm mocking myself, too.

[^8]: Alternative line that doesn't rhyme with the next one but is more quintessentially 2018: "From their [Facebook accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal)!"

[^9]: Did you *really* think I was done with the cheap shots at machine learning?

[^10]: The [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) reference is about cryptocurrency (e.g., [Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/)). Because that's pretty hip, too.
